on.

Demonstate shadows using the shadow map algorithm using a shader.

Key bindings
  m/M        Show/hide shadow map
  p/P        Switch shaders
  o/O        Cycle through objects
  +/-        Change light elevation
  []         Change light position
  s/S        Start/stop light movement
  <>         Decrease/increase number of slices in objects
  b/B        Toggle room box
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit


Changes:
shadow : original
shadow2: uses explicit computation of dot products and normalization
shadow3:
