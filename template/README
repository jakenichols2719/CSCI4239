hw1: NDC->RGB Shader

James Nichols
CSCI4239/5239 Spring 2021

Demonstrates use of vertex and fragment shaders

Key bindings
  m          Toggle shader
  o          Change objects
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

Just as a quick note, you mentioned we could use ex01 as a starting point, so
most of the files here are direct from that example, excluding ndcrgb.vert and
ndcrgb.frag.
